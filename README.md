# How to use

The high level steps are as follows

* cd repo
* pip install virtualenv (if you don't already have virtualenv installed)
* virtualenv venv to create your new environment (called 'venv' here)
* `source venv/bin/activate` to enter the virtual environment
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements in the current environment
* You will need to generate your own API secret from [Open AI](https://platform.openai.com/playground) *this is a free API for the most part if you are just playing about. You will incurr costs if you use it a lot. You can track your usage from the website*
